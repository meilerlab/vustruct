# [VUStruct](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39149406/): a compute pipeline for high throughput and personalized structural biology

This is the code repository for [VUStruct](https://meilerlab.org/VUStruct)

VUStruct is primary implemented in Python.  Production code is deployed in Singularity Containers (see containers/ for build scripts) with
an additional thin layer of python (flask) code to manage the web back-end  (see webfront/).

# We welcome collaborations:

- use of our open [website](https://meilerlab.org/VUStruct)
- deeper analysis of your data on our cluster
- deployment of VUStruct to your system
- suggestions for the VUStruct pipeline

This repository is maintained by
