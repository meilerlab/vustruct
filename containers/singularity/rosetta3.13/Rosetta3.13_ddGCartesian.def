# 2025-02-25 Build a Rosetta3.13_ddGCartesian.sif 
# singularity container with the Rocky9 Base OS
# with two Rosetta3.13 ddGCartesian component binaries and supporting
# Rosetta databases
#
# See the %help section below for more details
#
# The first layer is the latest Rocky Linux 9 OS
# which we obtain from dockerhub:
Bootstrap:docker
From:rockylinux:9
