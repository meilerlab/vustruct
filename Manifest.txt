Notes on creation of the psbadmin python environment.
IMPORTANT: All steps must be run as user psbadmin

1) Checkout CapraLab/psbadmin to /dors/capra_lab/users/psbadmin
   (The psbadmin git repository is essentially a backup of the write-protected /dors/capra_lab/users/psbadmin directory)

2) Checkout CapraLab/pdbmap to /dors/capra_lab/users/psbadmin/pdbmap

3) Download Anaconda2  and install to /dors/capra_lab/users/psbadmin/anaconda2

4) Install add-on libraries with:

pip install biopython
# Grab an Entity.py from pre 1.69 version and patch the new one!

pip install MySQL-python
pip install mysqlclient
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install argparse
# WeasyPrint no longer supports Python 2
pip install WeasyPrint==0.42.3
pip install PyVCF

# Newer versions of networkx have incompatible data file formats
pip install networkx==1.9

pip install fuzzywuzzy
pip install python-Levenshtein

5) Precompile all python modules as user psbadmin.  Currently, accomplished with

$ cd /dors/capra_lab/users/psbadmin
$ ./precompile.bash
